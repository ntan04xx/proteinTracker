# proteinTracker
ProteinTracker is a Django web app developed to be a useful tool in assisting users track their daily macronutrients intake (i.e. fat, calories, protein) in comparison to their target with the use of an external Nutritional Analysis API developed by Edamam. Target intakes for each macro are calculated using various factors supplied to the app by the user such as gender, height, age and level of physical activity. There are also user notifications when a daily target has been reached and a progress checker so users can see the remaining nutrients they need to eat before hitting a target.

To run the server, clone the git repo and create virtual environment using 'source proteinWorld/bin/activate' before navigating to proteinTracker repository and using command 'python manage.py runserver'. Make sure to have Django installed.
