# proteinTracker
ProteinTracker is a Django web app developed to be a useful tool in assisting users track their daily macronutrients intake (fat, calories, protein) in comparison to their target though an external Nutritional Analysis API developed by Edamam. Target intakes for each macro are calculated using various factors supplied to the app by the user such as current body fat percentage, height, age and level of physical activity. Currently, we hope to extend our app functionality by creating a user system and notify users when they have reached their required intake of a macro.
